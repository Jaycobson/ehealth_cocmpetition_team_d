# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Vaccination/Immunization Coverage in Nigeria

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed using LightGBM to predict vaccination/immunization coverage across different regions in Nigeria. Vaccination coverage is a critical public health indicator, and this model aims to provide insights and predictions that can aid in healthcare planning and decision-making.


The dataset used for this project includes historical data on vaccination/immunization coverage rates, population demographics, and other relevant features for different regions in Nigeria. You can find the dataset in the dataset directory.

## Model Training
Details about the model training process can be found in the .ipynb Jupyter Notebooks. You can explore them to see how the model was trained, tuned, and evaluated.
